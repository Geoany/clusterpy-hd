# ClusterPy HD

## This is not your regular Clusterpy
If that's what you are looking for, go to [Clusterpy on Github][1].

### Extra requirements
 * mpi4py
 * h5py (Compiled for parallel support)
 * cython

## Small print
This version is experimental and we are not giving support for it, but if you
want to contact us about it, leave an issue [here][2].

In this version we will run a clustering on relatively big maps using HDF5 and
MPI.

## License
Same as [Clusterpy][1].
